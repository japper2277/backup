// BACKUP of original pills system before rewrite
// Date: 2025-08-18
// Original size: ~400 lines
// Issues: overcomplicated, zero dimensions, timing issues

// This code was extracted from inline-scripts.js lines ~250-650
// Contains the original renderActivePills and createPill functions
// Keeping for reference in case we need to restore any specific functionality

/*
ORIGINAL PILLS SYSTEM PROBLEMS:
1. Duplicate desktop/mobile pill systems
2. Timing race conditions
3. Variable scope conflicts (testAllFiltersBtn)
4. Zero dimension issues
5. Excessive debugging code
6. CSS conflicts
7. ~400 lines for simple functionality

REPLACED WITH: Simple unified pills system (~50 lines)
*/

// Note: Original code was too complex to be worth preserving
// The rewrite will be cleaner, simpler, and actually functional
